## 🚀 Getting Start

To have a local copy and run the project, follow these simple steps.

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/felipe-parra/todo-app-vue.git
   ```

2. Install project packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### ☕ Start the project in local - Development mode

1.  Start the development server

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

2.  Go to the following address:
    ```
    http://localhost:5173
    ```

<!-- ### ☕ Initial database data

1. Running the seeder

  Note: it is important to understand that the seeder is going to insert initial data, and there may be conflicts with previously created initial data that has been modified.

    ```
    npm run seed
    ``` -->

### 😄 Usual problems

- When installing `node_modules`, there can commonly be problems installing the packages either due to cache or incomplete downloads due to internet connection problems.

_It can be solved by deleting the `node_modules` folder, and downloading them again:_

```
rm -rf node_modules
```
